# Favget

Favget is a high-performance backend service for fetching and delivering favicons (and other website icons) with global caching and CDN support.
It is designed to be **fast, reliable, and scalable** ‚Äî ideal for projects that need to resolve, cache, and serve icons for multiple domains.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç **Smart resolver** ‚Äì Parses HTML `<link rel="icon">`, `apple-touch-icon`, `mask-icon`, and falls back to `/favicon.ico`.
- üöÄ **Fast delivery** ‚Äì Cached in Redis (Upstash) and served instantly on subsequent requests.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud storage** ‚Äì Icons are uploaded and optimized via Cloudinary (`f_auto`, `q_auto`).
- üóÑÔ∏è **Persistent storage** ‚Äì Metadata stored in Neon (Postgres) for consistency and revalidation.
- üåç **Scalable hosting** ‚Äì Deployable on Fly.io or Google Cloud Run with minimal setup.
- üîí **Rate limiting** ‚Äì Prevents abuse with per-IP and per-domain control (via Redis).
- üì¶ **API-first** ‚Äì Simple endpoints for fetching icons or metadata.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** [Go](https://go.dev/)
- **Framework:** [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) (lightweight HTTP router)
- **Database:** [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/)
- **Cache:** [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/)
- **Storage/CDN:** [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
- **Hosting:** [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

## üìê Architecture

```text
Client ‚Üí Favget API
  ‚Ü≥ Redis (Upstash) ‚Äì fast cache lookup
  ‚Ü≥ Postgres (Neon) ‚Äì metadata persistence
  ‚Ü≥ Cloudinary ‚Äì optimized icon storage & CDN delivery
```

## üö¶ API Endpoints

- `GET /v1/icon?domain=example.com`
  ‚Üí Redirects (302) to Cloudinary URL for <img> usage.

- `POST /v1/refresh (protected)`
  ‚Üí Forces re-crawl and refresh of icon.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kudanilll/favget.git
cd favget
```

### 2. Set environment variables

1. Copy the sample and fill your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/db?sslmode=require
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:password@host:port
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME
APP_ENV=dev
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=86400
RATE_LIMIT_RPS=10
```

3. Make sure `.env` is ignored by git:

```bash
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

### 3. Run locally

```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

### 4. Test endpoint

```bash
curl -i "http://localhost:8080/v1/icon?domain=github.com"
```

### 5. Deploy

- Fly.io

```bash
flyctl launch
flyctl secrets set DATABASE_URL=... REDIS_URL=... CLOUDINARY_URL=...
flyctl deploy
```

- Cloud Run

```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT/favget
gcloud run deploy favget --image gcr.io/PROJECT/favget --platform managed --region asia-southeast2
```

## üìä Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS icons (
  domain TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  icon_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  source_url TEXT,
  etag TEXT,
  width INT,
  height INT,
  content_type VARCHAR(64),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## üîÆ Roadmap

- Add GraphQL endpoint
- Support multiple sizes & formats (ICO, SVG, PNG)
- Rate limiting middleware
- Background refresh jobs
